# Calories Burnt Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt based on various features such as age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, and exercise duration. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate estimations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used contains information about individuals and their corresponding calorie expenditure. It includes:
- Age, Gender, Height (cm), Weight (kg), Duration of exercise (minutes), Heart rate (bpm), Calories burnt

## 🔥 Model & Approach
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (XGBoost Regressor)
5. Performance Evaluation (R² Score, MAE, RMSE)

## 📊 Results
- Achieved an R² score of **99.8**
- Model performs well with minimal error
